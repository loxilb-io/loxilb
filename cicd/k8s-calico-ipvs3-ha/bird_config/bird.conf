# This is a basic configuration file, which contains boilerplate options and
# some basic examples. It allows the BIRD daemon to start but will not cause
# anything else to happen.
#
# Please refer to the BIRD User's Guide documentation, which is also available
# online at http://bird.network.cz/ in HTML format, for more information on
# configuring BIRD and adding routing protocols.

# Configure logging
#log syslog all;
log "/var/log/bird.log" { debug, trace, info, remote, warning, error, auth, fatal, bug };

# Set router ID. It is a unique identification of your router, usually one of
# IPv4 addresses of the router. It is recommended to configure it explicitly.
router id 192.168.90.9;

# Turn on global debugging of all protocols (all messages or just selected classes)
# debug protocols all;
# debug protocols { events, states };

# Turn on internal watchdog
# watchdog warning 5 s;
# watchdog timeout 30 s;

# You can define your own constants
# define my_asn = 65000;
# define my_addr = 198.51.100.1;

# Tables master4 and master6 are defined by default
# ipv4 table master4;
# ipv6 table master6;

# Define more tables, e.g. for policy routing or as MRIB
# ipv4 table mrib4;
# ipv6 table mrib6;

# The Device protocol is not a real routing protocol. It does not generate any
# routes and it only serves as a module for getting information about network
# interfaces from the kernel. It is necessary in almost any configuration.
protocol device {

# The direct protocol is not a real routing protocol. It automatically generates
# direct routes to all network interfaces. Can exist in as many instances as you
# wish if you want to populate multiple routing tables with direct routes.
protocol direct {
	#disabled;		# Disable by default
	ipv4;			# Connect to default IPv4 table
	#ipv6;			# ... and to default IPv6 table
}

# The Kernel protocol is not a real routing protocol. Instead of communicating
# with other routers in the network, it performs synchronization of BIRD
# routing tables with the OS kernel. One instance per table.
protocol kernel {
	ipv4 {			# Connect protocol to IPv4 table by channel
#	      table master4;	# Default IPv4 table is master4
#	      import all;	# Import to table, default is import all
	      export all;	# Export to protocol. default is export none
	};
#	learn;			# Learn alien routes from the kernel
#	kernel table 10;	# Kernel table to synchronize with (default: main)
    merge paths on;
}

# Another instance for IPv6, skipping default options
protocol kernel {
	ipv6 { export all; };

# Static routes (Again, there can be multiple instances, for different address
# families and to disable/enable various groups of static routes on the fly).
protocol static {
	ipv4;			# Again, IPv4 channel with default options

#	route 0.0.0.0/0 via 198.51.100.10;
#	route 192.0.2.0/24 blackhole;
#	route 10.0.0.0/8 unreachable;
#	route 10.2.0.0/24 via "eth0";

# Pipe protocol connects two routing tables. Beware of loops.
# protocol pipe {
